# Project_02_HamsterCompanion

We will work with a team to create an android application.

Project Goals and Requirements
The primary goal of this project is to practice designing, implementing, and testing an Android application. The focus is more on the process than the final product. The instructor is evaluating design skills and teamwork abilities.
The project will make use of various software development practices and tools, including:
Design documents
Android Room persistence
GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
Intent factories
Unit tests
And more!
